Quick and Dirty Lightshow

A pinball lampshow editor written by nodyeliab and curbfeeler from pinside.
Based on nodyeliab's work in progress lamp tool for microcontroller-based lightshows.
Modified by curbfeeler for P-ROC.

If you only want to run the tool without worrying about source and are using windows, just copy the contents of cslashtemp to 
C:\Temp and run the jar file.  The lampshow template files and ledmap.txt files need to exist in this C:\temp directory (for now)
